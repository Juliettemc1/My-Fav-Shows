<h3>Gossip Girl is a TV series about a bunch of privileged teenagers who attend a prestigious high school in the Upper East Side of New York City. Their private lives are always shared publicly by an unknown blogger with the alias “Gossip Girl.” I would recommend this show because it is a dramatic comfort show and you don’t have to pay much attention when watching it.</h3>
