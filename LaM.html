<h2>Liv and Maddie is a TV show about two identical teen twins, Liv and Maddie, when Liv returns from her successful career in Hollywood to family life in Wisconsin. Most events take place at their house with their family or at their local high school. I would recommend this show because it is lighthearted and funny. It reminds you that just because people are identical twins does not mean that they are the same person.</h2>
