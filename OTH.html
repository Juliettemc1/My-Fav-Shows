<h4>One Tree Hill is a TV show based in a Fictional town in North Carolina, Tree Hill. It follows the relationship between two teen half brothers, Nathan and Lucas Scott, and their friends and family. They begin as enemies, but later grow closer as the show progresses. The show starts with Lucas joining their high school basketball team, Tree Hill Ravens, from the help of the brothers’ uncle Keith. Nathan, the team’s captain, is threatened by this and this begins their feud. Lucas is also interested in Nathan’s girlfriend, Peyton Sawyer, but Peyton’s best friend, Brooke Davis, is interested in Lucas. Lucas starts dating Brooke, but Nathan eventually breaks up with Peyton and starts dating Lucas’ best friend, Haley James. While Lucas and Brooke are together, Lucas cheats on Brooke with Peyton and they later break up. Lucas and Nathan’s father, Dan Scott, abandoned Lucas, when he was first born, for Nathan. Their relationships are explored throughout the span of the show.

 I personally like the show and would recommend it for other people because it is an emotional rollercoaster and it brings out a lot of emotions. I really enjoyed seeing the characters develop and grow through the course of their lives.</h4>
